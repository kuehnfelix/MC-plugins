# Minecraft-Plugins
This is a collection of some Minecraft/Bukkit plguins i made for a minigame-server that unfortunately never got properly released :( There are also some plguins that were used in different Minecraft-projects.


Here's a short info about each one:

## BedWars, SurvivalGames, KnockFFA
Those were gamemodes for the "Wolfsbau" Minecraft network.


## BungeeCommand
It was also meant to be on the "Wolfsbau" Minecraft network just providing a /hub command to send players to the server-hub.


## Chat
Marks the Chatmessages on the "Wolfsbau" Server accordingly to the rank of the msg-sender.


## Flummi
Is a fun little plugin which makes Projectiles bounce off of surfaces and was used as a lobby gimmick.


## Lobby-Gadgets
A System for all Items Players needed to navigate the "Wolfsbau"-server.


## MC-1650, piratebattle
This was a plugin used for the MC-1650 roleplay-project situated in the pirate era. 
The plugin allows players to travel to another port with ships.

The piratebattle plugin was a small helper plugin used for a special event in the project where the 2 Teams were on ships and had to shoot each other with TNT-cannons.


## MC-Payback
Payback was a Minecraft Project in 2018 similar to "VaRo". This plugin managed the gameplay of that project (Teams, Timelimits, Teamchests, Announcements sent to Discord, etc.).


## bwSigns
This is a plugin made for the "Wolfsbau"-server which managed the signs players had to click to join into minigames.
